            <h3>Casing</h3>
            <p>
                The casing is the outermost component of the lamp, designed to house and protect
                the internal components. It is composed of three parts: the bottom, made of a
                plastic that diffuses the light, the middle, made of a hard plastic, and the top,
                housing the power button, charging port, and hook. The casing can be disassembled
                by unscrewing the screws on top applying pressure to the seam between the bottom 
                diffusion plastic and the middle hard plastic and then pull apart the two parts. 
                The casing is durable, as it is difficult to disassemble, which makes it more 
                waterproof. However, this makes it harder to repair. It is 18.5 cm tall and has a 
                radius of 5 cm. There is not much to improve aside from changing the type of the 
                screws, but it is not a major issue.

            <h3>Battery</h3>
            <p>
                The battery is what powers the lamp. It is, actually 4 Li-Ion batteries,
                connected in parallel with a strip of conductive material (likely to be 
                aluminium) and wrapped with a polymer-like material. Wires are soldered 
                to the metal strips and to the battery terminals of both PCBs. The four
                batteries are encased in foam in order to prevent shaking around, and 
                having the batteries bump into other components and damaging them. Li-ion
                batteries are not the best choice as they are heavier and bulkier than Li-Pos. 
                However, they are more durable and have a longer life, and also do not bloat.
