            <h3>Casing</h3>
            <p>
                The casing is the outermost component of the lamp, designed to house and protect
                the internal components. It is composed of three parts: the bottom, made of a
                plastic that diffuses the light, the middle, made of a hard plastic, and the top,
                housing the power button, charging port, and hook. The casing can be disassembled
                by unscrewing the screws on top applying pressure to the seam between the bottom 
                diffusion plastic and the middle hard plastic and then pull apart the two parts. 
                The casing is durable, as it is difficult to disassemble, which makes it more 
                waterproof. However, this makes it harder to repair. It is 18.5 cm tall and has a 
                radius of 5 cm. There is not much to improve aside from changing the type of the 
                screws, but it is not a major issue.

            <h3>Battery</h3>
            <p>
                The battery is what powers the lamp. It is, actually 4 Li-Ion batteries,
                connected in parallel with a strip of conductive material (likely to be 
                aluminium) and wrapped with a polymer-like material. Wires are soldered 
                to the metal strips and to the battery terminals of both PCBs. The four
                batteries are encased in foam in order to prevent shaking around, and 
                having the batteries bump into other components and damaging them. Li-ion
                batteries are not the best choice as they are heavier and bulkier than Li-Pos. 
                However, they are more durable and have a longer life, and also do not bloat.

            <h3>PCB (1)</h3>
            <p>
                The first PCB is the one that connects to the battery. It has 
                a TTRS jack to charge the battery and a push button to toogle 
                the power of the lamp. It is mounted onto the top of the case 
                and screwed in with screws. This is a good design choice, as 
                it is easy to produce, and does not require wires, with the 
                exception of the wires that are soldered onto the PCB to connect 
                the battery and light. It is made of copper for the traces, 
                silkscreen, and solder mask. However, the PCB is a bit frustrating 
                to disassemble, as some components that are soldered wrong require
                desoldering, but this isn't much of an issue.

            <h3>PCB (2)</h3>
            <p>
                This is the PCB that the lights are soldered onto. It recieves 
                power from the battery, and distributes it to the lights. It 
                has wires soldered onto it from the first PCB to get the on/off 
                signal from the push button. It is mounted onto the bottom of the 
                case and is made of aluminium, and most likely copper for the traces. 
                However, the PCB, due to being made of aluminum flexes and bends, 
                which may cause some issues. There seem to be no issues for that, so 
                it may not be a huge

            <h3>Foam</h3>
            <p>
                This is one of the more simple components. The lamp's 
                battery is encased in a thick foam, which not only protects 
                the batteries from being damaged, but also from rattling 
                around, which may cause the wires soldered on to snap, or
                damage other components. However, this is not the best idea, 
                as it adds to the weight of the lamp, and makes disassembly 
                harder, as it is held in by friction.
